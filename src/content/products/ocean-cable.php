            As of our Fiber Optics cable that we provide is a well welded-steel-tube armored with Corning glass that can be laid without any specialized equipment such as in many ways including shallow direct burying, aerial wiring, submerging; and that too without splicing the cable up to 10 Miles. The cable has been designed in the concept of DIY (Do-It-Yourself) laying without demanding heavy machinery nor high-tech fiber splicing. The cable can be laid with a little guidance from a technical person and, moreover, the community can be involved in cable laying, trouble shooting and repairing. Such initiative not only reduces the cost and duration of installation but also caters the lower OPEX in the long run. Their experience for more than last five decades in cable technology have proven to be one of the leaders in manufacturing optical cable. The cable can be laid in utility trench or even in the sewerage system with clamps. This is another justification on the installation part as that the cable can be laid in any environment from land to water to air; thereby avoiding additional construction work for "special" environment that come across.

        <p>Affordable yet reliable and scalable solutions for fiber optics broadband backhaul or backbone solutions and FTTx
            for Rural Areas, ITU-T L.1700 standardized cable, which can be laid easily in all terrain with ease, DIY - Do-It-Yourself technology. No need to have special skill!.Semi-burial or non-burial fiber protected by a continuous stainless steel metallic tube. Though protected by steel, it is thin in nature and very light to carry. The cable is tested to be rodent proof with non-flammability. The cable has no electromagnetic interference and does not carry any power supply.

            The manufacturer of such cable is Ocean Cable and Communications Japan, who has always been in the forefront of providing state-of-the-art submarine based cable technology to the World. Their experience for more than last five decades in cable technology have proven to be one of the leaders in manufacturing optical cable.

                F-PAC cable is consisted of one / several stainless tube(s) having optical fibers. The superior quality of stainless tube is assured by our long experiences as one of the world's largest manufacturer. The application of this cable is wide-ranging such as communication cables, cables for CATV, temperature sensor cable, and quickfix cable in a time of disaster, taking advantage of its flexibility and withstanding pressure. High rate of filling gel and high excess fiber length (up to 0.6%) achieved by unique process enhance reliability in a variety of applications above. FEATURES- Light weight and small diameter - Overwhelming properties for withstanding pressure. For more please download below products details.
